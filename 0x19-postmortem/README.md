Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

- Duration:
  - Start Time: November 10, 2023, 15:30 UTC
  - End Time: November 10, 2023, 18:45 UTC

- Impact:
  - Service: API Gateway
  - User Experience: 70% of users experienced intermittent delays and failures in API requests during the outage.

Timeline:

- 15:30 UTC: Issue Detected
  - An automated monitoring alert flagged a significant increase in error rates on the API Gateway.

- 15:35 UTC: Investigation Initiated
  - The operations team started investigating the issue, assuming a potential infrastructure problem.

- 16:00 UTC: Misleading Path
  - Initial investigation focused on server infrastructure and load balancers, leading to a misleading assumption of increased traffic causing the issue.

- 16:30 UTC: Escalation
  - Operations escalated the incident to the development team as the infrastructure seemed stable, and the issue hinted at a possible application layer problem.

- 17:00 UTC: Correct Path Identified
  - After thorough investigation by the development team, it was discovered that the master-slave configuration between two critical components was misconfigured.

- 17:30 UTC: Further Escalation
  - The incident was escalated to database administrators to correct the misconfigured master node.

- 18:00 UTC: Journal Configuration Verification
  - While investigating, I, as the lead engineer, recreated the user in the master node and verified the journal configuration. The error message "permission denied" prompted a closer examination of user permissions.

- 18:30 UTC: Permission Denied Issue
  - Checking the master node revealed a permission denied error in the MySQL logs. The user recreation was necessary to align permissions correctly.

- 18:45 UTC: Issue Resolved
  - The misconfiguration in the master node, including the user recreation and permission adjustments, was corrected, restoring normal functionality to the API Gateway.

Root Cause and Resolution:

- Root Cause:
  - The root cause was a misconfiguration in the master node of the database replication setup, specifically related to user permissions.

- Resolution:
  - The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the master node with the correct settings, recreating the user with appropriate permissions, and ensuring proper synchronization with the slave node.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- Improvements/Fixes:
  - Enhanced Monitoring: Implement more granular monitoring on the database replication status to promptly identify configuration issues.

  - Configuration Management: Establish stricter configuration management practices, including regular audits of critical settings to prevent misconfigurations.

  - Documentation Review: Update and review documentation related to the master-slave configuration to ensure accuracy and completeness.

- Tasks to Address the Issue:
  - Immediate Action:
    - Correct the misconfiguration on the master node.
    - Recreate the user with appropriate permissions.

  - Short Term:
    - Conduct a thorough review of the entire configuration for potential misalignments.
    - Implement additional logging to capture configuration changes and potential issues.

  - Long Term:
    - Develop automated configuration validation checks to ensure the correctness of critical settings.
    - Conduct regular training sessions for the operations team on identifying and resolving configuration-related issues.

This incident highlighted the importance of hands-on investigation, user recreation, and meticulous permission checks. The corrective and preventative measures implemented aim to fortify the system against similar incidents in the future, ensuring a more resilient and reliable web stack.
